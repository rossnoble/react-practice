# Date Picker

## Challenge:
Build a date picker from scratch using React.

## Goal 1:
- Build a calendar grid that permits traversing month/year combinations correctly.
- On mount, it will show the current month/year in the date picker
- Left and right navigation moved one month forward or backward

## Goal 2:
- Highlight the current date selected in the calendar grid and permit the user to change the selected date
- Make sure the selected date is persisted when navigating between months/years

## Goal 3:
- Connect to an input field that updates the value from the datepicker
- Changing the value in the input updates the datepicker UI
