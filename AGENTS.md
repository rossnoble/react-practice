# AGENTS

Style rules to follow:

- Use named exports instead of default exports unless told otherwise
- Prefer `type` to `interface` in TypeScript types
- Create TypeScript files for new challanges and components

## Creating new challenges

I will ask you to create new challenges. This will live in `src/challenges`.
Leave new challenges as empty functions ready to be filled in.

```tsx
export function NameOfExercise() {
  // Ready to fill in here
}
```

The `README.md` in each challenge should follow this format:

```
# {name of challenge}

{brief description of the challenge}
